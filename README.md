- 👋 Hi, I’m @bcornick
- 👀 I’m interested in: way too many things! Most notably, I am interested in the intersection of blockchain with machine learning and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more: front-end web development (React/NextJS/Typescript) and blockchain dev (Solidity).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: anything related to web3 and science!
